#In this SQL, I have created a querty that uses two CTEs, product_stats and category_stats, to calculate intermediate results and simplify the final query. The result is a table that displays the category, total units sold, total revenue, average price, and average revenue per unit, ordered by total revenue in descending order.

WITH product_stats AS (
  SELECT
    product_id,
    SUM(units_sold) AS units_sold,
    SUM(units_sold * price) AS revenue,
    AVG(price) AS avg_price
  FROM orders
  JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id
  GROUP BY product_id
),
category_stats AS (
  SELECT
    category,
    SUM(units_sold) AS units_sold,
    SUM(revenue) AS revenue,
    AVG(avg_price) AS avg_price
  FROM product_stats
  JOIN categories ON product_stats.product_id = categories.product_id
  GROUP BY category
)
SELECT
  category,
  units_sold,
  revenue,
  avg_price,
  revenue / units_sold AS avg_revenue_per_unit
FROM category_stats
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
